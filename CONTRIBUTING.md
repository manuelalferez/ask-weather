1. **Make a Fork** of the project.

   In the upper left corner of the page you will find a button, click on **Fork**.

2. On GitHub, **navigate to the Fork** that has been generated for you.

3. **Clone the project**.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ask-weather
   ```

4. **Create a branch**, thereby protecting the `master` branch.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b "name-of-your-branch"
   ```

   You can read more information about the reason for this step in:

   - [Protecting the master branch](https://cityofaustin.github.io/ctm-dev-workflow/protected-branches.html)

5. **Contribute your improvements** to the project.

6. **Save** the changes.

   ```bash
   git add.
   git commit -m "Description of the change you have made"
   ```

7. **Upload the changes** to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin "name-of-your-branch"
   ```

8. On GitHub, **do a pull request** by clicking the _Compare & pull request_ button.

9. In the new window, **describe the changes you have added** and point out why they are important.

10. **Send the pull request** by clicking _Create pull request_.
